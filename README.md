# Mini-File-Icons

A subset of [File-Icons-VSCode](https://github.com/file-icons/vscode).
Like [File-Icons-VSCode](https://github.com/file-icons/vscode),
this font uses several icons from [Devicons](https://github.com/vorillaz/devicons),
[Mfixx](https://github.com/fizzed/font-mfizz),
[Octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons),
[Nonicons](https://github.com/yamatsum/nonicons)
and of cource [File-Icons](https://github.com/file-icons/icons).

This font is extremely personal choice,
so if you want more or less then fork it and change.
